              <p class="about_me"> I am a student from KMC and have recently given my +2 examination.I have always loved coding since school.
                                   I took great interest in QBASIC at school. I also studied computer science in +2 so, that I can presue my 
                                   interest and love for coding in the future. I have a good knowledge in C programming as I studied it in 
                                   +2. Moreover in my free time, I used to learn python using different websites.I am learning
                                   different coding language. For my undergrad degree I will join Bsc. Csit to enhance my knowledge in the 
                                   field in which I am interested.  </p>

                                   <p class="about_me">Nowadays I am learning coding from Levelup a platform that provides us with complete  
                                    knowledge about machine language, but I am not limiting myself only in field of coding. I also work as a 
                                    part time tuition teacher. I teach students of class 6-7. I am also improving my communication skills and trying to be
                                    a better version of myself.</p>
